		<text>A RPD machinegun customized by mechanics of The zone. The barrel has been chopped down to make it more manuverable in The Zone's urban environments. Threading has been added for a supressor and the belt cover has been modified for a picatinny rail mount, allowing it to accept scopes and optics. The rate of fire has also been increased. \n \n

			Drum magazine with a belt for the RPD. The box has been stuffed with a 125-round belt. While the RPD was ultimately supplanted by the more accurate and flexible RPK, being able to shoot off 125 rounds is nothing to scoff at.
